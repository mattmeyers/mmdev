I'm a software engineer at {{< extlink href="https://madwire.com" title="Madwire" >}} in Fort Collins, CO (although I work remotely from Virginia). Nowadays I'm mainly a backend PHP engineer, but I occasionally get to work with Go and Typescript. I take pride in writing code that is well documented, easy to maintain, and naturally extensible.

Outside of work I enjoy deepening my knowledge in various computer science topics. Lately I've been interested in programming language theory, compiler design, and computer networking. I also enjoy working on open source projects including a {{< extlink href="https://github.com/mattmeyers/vscode-dbml" title="VS Code extension" >}} and some Go libraries. Check out my [projects page](/projects/) for more details.

When I'm not writing code, I like to stay active. I spend most of my time bouldering at the local climbing gym where I'm slowly climbing the grades. I also enjoy getting outdoors by hiking the local trails or swinging in a hammock in the local park. To fuel all of the activity, I like to cook fresh vegetarian dishes and bake crispy loaves of bread.
