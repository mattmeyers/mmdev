This Visual Studio Code extension provides language support for the Database Markup Language ([DBML](https://dbml.org)). Features include syntax highlighting, language snippets, and pass-through commands to the DBML CLI tool. These commands allow the user to convert between SQL and DBML from within VS Code.

Future plans for this project includes integration with a custom DBML language server which is in the early stages of development.
